                Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; (21 April 1926 â€“ 8 September 2022) was
                 Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 
                 February 1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen regnant of 32
                 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the 
                 monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 
                 years is the longest of any British monarch and the second longest
                  verified reign of any monarch of a sovereign state in history.
                Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her paternal 
                grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess
                 of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother).
                  Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother
                   Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. 
                   She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during 
                   the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 
                   1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and 
                   their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.
